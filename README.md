# RSA-Encryption
This Hub is encryption system based on RSA System that uses Public Key and Private key generated by 15-20 digit long two primer Number. 
Data are encrypted using public key that is visible to all but to decrypt msg or data, we must nned private key. So it was used to encrypt messege in transition.
for start program...


first create two key from createkey.py and save them to
!! private.pem !!
!! public.pem !!

Then Run encrypt_rsa.py to start encryption....it will use public to encrypt input and save the output to autogenerated 
>>encrypted data.txt

Then when we run decrypt_rsa.py to start decrypt...it will use private key and use encrypted msg as a input. then it saves its output decrypted data to automatically generated 
>>decrypted data.txt
